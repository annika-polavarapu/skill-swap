
Meeting notes:
We talked about crucial components that were missing in our webpage so far and decided to prioritize them over, such as getting login and registration working, along with having our main pages setup.

Release notes:

Gavin-> implemented scheduling front end. Wrote code which populates 7 columns with current dates. Implemented 
buttons which cycle through dates to allow users to navigate scheduled dates for the week. Added functionality to 
erase scheduled events from screen when dates cycled through to prevent event burn in. 

Anthony -> Logout code was written (Functionality needs to checked). Going to be working on nav and profile picture for the user.

Annnika -> Login/Registration pages made. Going to be working on the skills page frontend and backend.
