Meeting notes:
We discussed our progress so far and what we hope to achieve in the next week. The current priorities are getting the 
scheduling page working, and getting the profile page up. We completed the about page, the registration/login/logout page
and we completed some unit testing. We also found and fixed some issues with our databse.
